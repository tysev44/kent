# Layering gradients to follow border-radius

A Pen created on CodePen.

You can switch between the 2D and the 3D view. The idea behind layering gradients is explained in my CSS-Tricks article [The `background-clip` Property and its Use Cases](https://css-tricks.com/the-backgound-clip-property-and-use-cases/).

Demo created for my CSS-Tricks article [Restricting a (pseudo) element to its parentâ€™s border-box](https://css-tricks.com/restricting-a-pseudo-element-to-its-parents-border-box/) (all demos for this article can be found in [this collection](https://codepen.io/collection/DPKjjZ/)).

Also used in my [CSS-ing Candy Ghost Buttons](https://css-tricks.com/css-ing-candy-ghost-buttons/) article on CSS-Tricks.

* if you're from outside Europe, becoming a patron on Patreon (don't use it for one time donations or if you're from Europe, we're both getting ripped off)

* or at least sharing this to show the world what can be done with CSS these days

Thank you!
