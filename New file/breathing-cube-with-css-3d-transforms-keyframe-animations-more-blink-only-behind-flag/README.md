A Pen created on CodePen.

[Watch me code this](https://youtu.be/I7M-anQFfiM) in ~30 minutes (you can speed it up if I'm too slow) . 3D version of [previous demo](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/gzoBoM/). **No JS was used to create this shape, it's all CSS 3D transforms + `clip-path`!** Only Blink browsers with the Experimental Web Platform features flag enabled - see image below for how to enable it:
